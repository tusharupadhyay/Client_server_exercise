Learned how to create server/client with asyncore module provided by python.

With asyncore module, server creating becomes very easy.
To create a server, need to create a channel by creating an instances of class asyncore.dispatcher.
This adds the channel to a global map, used by the loop() function.
once making a call to loop() function, it will start the channel service.

Learned about asyncore module from python's documentation on python website.


While using Twisted Python module to create a server, learned these things about Twisted module.
Twisted module have implemented a number of protocols already, which means we can use this to 
talk to remote server without worrying about implementation by ourself.

Twisted can handle thousands of connections in a single thread, which tends
 to work better than having thousands of threads, each for a single connection. Because of this,

Also, With Twisted module, it's less coding to create the server, and Simple is better than complex which
is one of the principal of The Zen of Python.

Also, while working on this assignment, learned about modulazing the code, and how to write code
in python by following it's principal.

With unit testing module, covered the edge case of the code, so that code should run smoothly.
With unit test, we always make sure, our code does what it is intended to do, and avoid run time exceptions.
